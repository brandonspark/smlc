# smlc

I couldn't be bothered to think of a better name.

This is a wrapper over the SML/NJ REPL, designed to mimic a "compiler extension"
for the SML/NJ compiler, that implements "C-like syntax". Currently, it can do
most of the things through the first 6 weeks of 150, minus datatypes.

It also has options for a few 150-related jokes. This was for my 150 interview.
Please consider my candidacy.

I'll bet you've never used Unix pipes in SML before.
